## Preparation

You will find the material for this lecture on github here <https://github.com/cbhurley/CRT2022vis>
and a copy of this lecture
[here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cbhurley/CRT2022vis/blob/master/lect2.html)


First install these packages

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages(c("GGally", "ISLR2", "naniar", "hexbin"))
```

and load with

```{r}
library(GGally)
library(ISLR2)
library(timetk) # for the data
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)
bike <- bike_sharing_daily %>%
  mutate(season = recode_factor(
    season,
    `1` = "Winter",
    `2` = "Spring",
    `3` = "Summer",
    `4` = "Fall"
  )) %>%
  mutate(weathersit =
           recode_factor(
             weathersit,
             `1` = "clear",
             `2` = "cloudy",
             `3` = "lightP",
             `4` = "heavyP"
           )) %>%
  mutate(holiday = recode_factor(holiday,
                                 `0` = "No",
                                 `1` = "Yes")) %>%
  mutate(workingday = recode_factor(workingday,
                                    `0` = "No",
                                    `1` = "Yes")) %>%
  mutate(yr = recode_factor(yr,
                            `0` = 2011,
                            `1` = 2012))

bike$month <- factor(month.abb[bike$mnth], levels = month.abb)

bike$yday <-
  lubridate::yday(bike$dteday)  # gives the day in year of the dteday variable

```


## Big data

ISLR2 has an hourly version of the bike data with 8645  observations.

The plot of registered versuscasual users is

```{r,  fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data=Bikeshare, aes(x=casual, y=registered)) + geom_point()
```

There is likely lot of overplotting.

There is likely lot of overplotting.  To check this

```{r}
c(nrow(Bikeshare), nrow(distinct(select(Bikeshare, registered, casual))))
```


Jittering will randomly undo rounding, and using alpha will help too

```{r,  fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data=Bikeshare, aes(x=casual, y=registered)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=.5, size=.5)
```

So now the overplotting is most severe for registered < 200 and casual < 50.

Other options are to form 2d bins, count the number of observations in each, and color in
proportion to the frequency.

```{r,  fig.width=5, fig.height=4}

p <- ggplot(data=Bikeshare, aes(x=registered, y=casual))
p+ geom_bin2d()
```

I prefer to make my colour scale light to dark:
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
p +  
  geom_bin2d() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "wheat", high = "blue")

p +  
  geom_bin2d() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "wheat", high = "blue" ,trans="log10")
```

The second plot takes a log of the counts so you get a better spread of colours. This is needed because there is so
much skewness in the count distribution.

```{r,  fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
p +  
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "wheat", high = "blue" ,trans="log10")
```
`stat_binhex` uses hexagonal binning

 A more advanced plot fits a 2d kernel density estimate and draw this as a contour plot.
 
```{r} 
#| layout-ncol: 2
p + geom_density2d()

p + stat_density2d(aes(fill = after_stat(level)), geom = "polygon") +
 scale_fill_gradient(low = "wheat", high = "blue")

```  

```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
p + geom_density2d_filled() 

```

We no longer need the logged colour scale, because the bivariate density smooths out the count distribution.

The second plot fills in the contours with color.

Every `geom_` function has an associated `stat_` function that does the necessary calculations.

Conversely, every `stat_` function has an associated `geom_` function to do the drawing. So instead of
`geom_density2d` you could use  `stat_density2d` and you would get the same plot.

However, if you want to draw the density with a different `geom` other than the default `contour`, you need
to use `stat_density2d` and specify the new `geom`, here `polygon"`.

For this data, the density plot smears out the two "wings" of the plot, so either the `geom_bin` or `geom_hex` with
the logged colour scale is better.



## Scatterplot matrix

Back to the smaller dataset.

Go to articles tab for info
<https://ggobi.github.io/ggally/>


```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(bike, columns=c("casual","registered","cnt" ))
```

You can change what is plotted on lower, upper and diagonal,using
`lower=` etc.
Putting in `mapping=` gives densities for both years separately


```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
ggpairs(
  bike,
  mapping = aes(color = yr),
  columns = c("casual", "registered", "cnt"),
  lower = list(continuous =  wrap(
    "smooth",
    method = "lm",
    se = F,
    alpha = .5
  )),
  diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag", alpha = 0.5))
)
```


`ggpairs` can handle factors as well.
In this plot `yrs` is in as a plot variable, and as colour.

```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
ggpairs(
  bike,
  mapping = aes(color = yr),
  columns = c("casual", "registered", "cnt", "yr"),
  lower = list(continuous =  wrap(
    "smooth",
    method = "lm",
    se = F,
    alpha = .5
  )),
  diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag", alpha = 0.5))
)
 
```

## Parallel coordinates

These can be constructed with function `ggparcoord` from GGally.

But, a newer package called `ggpcp` is better.

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("yaweige/ggpcp", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Construction: with a sample of 20 bike observations




```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align="center", eval=T, echo=F}

s <- sample(nrow(bike),20)
ggparcoord(bike[s,], columns=match(c("casual","registered","cnt"),names(bike)),
           groupColumn = "yr",
           showPoints=TRUE,
           alphaLines=0,scale="uniminmax")

ggparcoord(bike[s,], columns=match(c("casual","registered","cnt"),names(bike)),
           groupColumn = "yr",
           showPoints=TRUE,
           alphaLines=1,scale="uniminmax")

ggparcoord(bike[s,], columns=match(c("casual","registered","cnt"),names(bike)),
           groupColumn = "yr",scale="uniminmax")
```

This is how you create the parallel coordinate plot in `ggpcp`

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
library(ggpcp)
ggplot(bike[s,], aes(color=yr)) + geom_pcp(aes(vars=vars(casual,registered, cnt)))
```

Here, all variables are scaled to the unit interval individually.
Variables that are positively correlated will have parallel line segments, here registered and cnt.

Other scaling options are available eg

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(bike[s,], aes(color=yr)) + geom_pcp(aes(vars=vars(casual,registered, cnt)), method="raw")

```
In raw, no scaling is done. Here you can see that most users per day are registered.

To see what certain patterns look like in a parallel coordinate plot, let
us look at some fake data

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}

x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x+ .3*rnorm(100)
z <- -y+ .1*rnorm(100)
w <- -z+ .5*rnorm(100)
ggplot(data.frame(x,y,z,w))+ geom_pcp(aes(vars=vars(everything())))
```

Positive correlation exhibits as parallel segments.

Negative correlation has crossing. The stronger the negative correlation the smaller the pinch point.




```{r,fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(bike, aes(color=workingday)) + geom_pcp(aes(vars=vars(casual,registered, cnt)), alpha=.4)

```

In the above we see that there is a difference in the casual-registered association for workingday or not.
Both groups have positive association but slopes are different.
There are more casual users at the weekend.

Verifying with a scatterplot

```{r,  fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data=bike, aes(x=casual, y=registered, color=workingday)) + geom_point()
```

The same pattern was evident in the full bike data.

Standard parallel coordinate plots require numeric variables. There are variants that have been defined for
categorical variables.

With `ggpcp` factor variables can be used as an axis variable:

```{r,fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(bike, aes(vars=vars( workingday,casual,registered, cnt), color=workingday)) + 
  geom_pcp(alpha=.4)

ggplot(bike, aes(vars=vars( workingday,casual,registered, cnt), color=workingday)) + 
   geom_pcp_box(boxwidth = 0.1, fill="grey70")+
    geom_pcp(alpha=.4,boxwidth = 0.1)+
   geom_pcp_text(boxwidth = 0.1)


```

Other variants of parallel coordinate plots for categorical data are in ggalluvial, ggparallel, but these are for
factors only.

## Practice 3

Using the `penguins` dataset, make a plot of  the four dimension variables, colored by species.

```{r,practice3, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.align="center", echo=F, eval=F}
ggpairs(na.omit(penguins), mapping = aes(color = species),
            columns=c(3:6),
  lower = list(continuous =  wrap("smooth", method="lm", se=F, alpha=.5)),
  diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag", alpha=0.5 )))
```


```{r, practice3,eval=F}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Solution"

```

Which pair of variables and species has the highest correlation?

Can you find two variables with negative correlation, but positive correlation within each species?
This is called Simpson's paradox.

Then make a parallel coordinate plot of the same four variables, with the same colouring scheme.

Can you identify presence of positive and negative correlation?

In this plot, how does the Gentoo species compare to the other two species?

Finally, make a parallel coordinate plot of species, island, and body_mass_g, coloured by species.
How many species are on each island?

```{r,fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align="center", echo=F, eval=F}

ggplot(penguins, aes(vars=vars(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g), color=species))+
        geom_pcp(alpha=.4)


ggplot(penguins, aes(vars=vars(species, island, starts_with("body")), color=species))+
  geom_pcp_box(boxwidth = 0.1, fill="grey70")+
  geom_pcp(alpha=.4,boxwidth = 0.1)+
  geom_pcp_text(boxwidth = 0.1)

```

## Missing data

Here we use package naniar.



```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
library(palmerpenguins)
gg_miss_case(penguins)
gg_miss_var(penguins)
```
There are also facet options.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
gg_miss_case(penguins, facet=species)
gg_miss_var(penguins, facet=species)
```

Adelie and Gentoo have a few cases with missing values, Chinstrap cases
are all complete.

The variables plot tells us that sex has the most missing values. There are just a few missings in the  measurement variables.


The visualisation `vis_miss` is a heatmap identifying which values are missing in the dataset.


```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=6}

vis_miss(penguins)
```



For the penguins, this tells us that there is one penguin each of the two Species that is missing on the numeric variables.

These numeric values are not missing at random. It could simply be there are
two penguins that they were not able to measure.

An alternative visualisation for exploring combinations of variables that are missing is the upset plot

```{r}
gg_miss_upset(penguins)
```

- This one tells us directly the numbers of missings on each of the variables.
- There are 9 cases with missing sex only
- There are two cases missing on the five listed variables.

## titanic case study

There were 2201 people aboard the titanic when it sank in 1912.
A summary of the people on board and whether they survived or not is given in the titanicanic dataset.

Here are some images as it left its last port of call, Cobh.


::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](figs/titanic.png)

![](figs/cobh.png)
:::

Can we figure out from this data which category of passenger had the highest chance of survival?

This case study looks at 4 categorical variables simultaneously:
- Survival (yes or no), 
- class (first, second, third, crew,)
- gender (male or female) and 
- age (child or adult).


First we look at the number of survivors by class
```{r,  fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
#titanicanic  # a 4d array....
titanic <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
head(titanic)
titanic<- titanic[c(17:32,1:16),]

ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Class, y = Freq,fill=Survived)) +
  geom_col() 
```

and then the survival rates by class

```{r,  fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Class, y = Freq,fill=Survived)) +
  geom_col(position="fill") 
```


- There is a big difference in Survival rates across the classes.
- First class passengers have the highest chance of survival, crew members the lowest. 


We can bring in gender with `facet_wrap`

```{r,  fig.width=5.5, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Class, y = Freq,fill=Survived)) +
  geom_col(position="fill") + 
  facet_wrap( ~ Sex) + ylab("Rate")
```

- Third class females do worse than crew females (46% versus 87%), and
third class males do worse than crew males (17% versus 22%), although when gender is ignored the situation is
reversed.

- This apparent paradox (Simpson's paradox) occurs because the vast majority of crew members are male.

- The overall 3rd class survival rate of 25% is an average of 46% and 17%, but as there are 2.6 times
more men than women in 3rd class 17% gets more weight.

- The overall crew survival rate of 24% is an average of 87% and 22\%, but as there are 37 times
more men than women in crew class 87% gets very little weight.

Finally, bringing in age
```{r,  fig.width=5.5, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Class, y = Freq,fill=Survived)) +
  geom_col(position="fill") + 
  facet_wrap( ~ Age+ Sex) + ylab("Rate")
```

We can get some simplification by showing the survival rate, that is omit the red sections.


```{r,  fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center"}
titanicR <- 
titanic %>%  group_by(Class, Sex,Age) %>%
summarise(died=Freq[2], survived=Freq[1], rate=survived/sum(Freq))
titanicR

ggplot(data = titanicR, aes(x = Class, y = rate)) +
  geom_col(fill="lightblue") + 
  facet_wrap( ~ Age+ Sex) 


  
```

One of the examples in the `ggpcp` vignette has a parallel coordinates version of this data:
<https://github.com/yaweige/ggpcp>  


```{r, echo=F, eval=T,  out.width="50%",fig.align='center', fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figs/pcp.png"))
```

## Practice 4

Explore the survival rates for the data `lusitania.csv` on <https://github.com/cbhurley/CRT2022vis>
This is a tabulated version of the data, in the same format as `titanic`. The complete dataset
is available on Kaggle.
